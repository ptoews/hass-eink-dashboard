# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.7.1-ptoews] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **`layout`** option on the Entity widget: `auto` (default),
  `inline` (icon in its own column beside the value) or `stacked`
  (icon on the name's line so the value spans the full card
  width). Pin it when a dashboard's entity cards vary in size and
  would otherwise show a mix of both arrangements.

### Fixed

- **Entity widget layout**: the redesign in 0.7.0 sized the card
  frame from the widget's full height rather than one row of it,
  which inflated the padding, corner radius and `left_bar` accent
  roughly 2.5x, and pinned the value text at 0.21x the widget
  height regardless of the space available. Card framing now
  scales with the card's smaller dimension, and the type scale is
  fitted to the content box: the value grows to fill the height it
  is given, clamped only by the width it has to fit. Text is
  placed on measured cap heights so the visible ink — not the
  font's line box — is what gets centred, and a name too wide for
  the card shrinks and then truncates instead of overflowing or
  shrinking the value.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- **`invert_condition`** option on the Tile and Entity widgets: a
  list of Lovelace condition dicts, same format as `visibility`.
  When the conditions are met the widget renders inverted (solid
  black card, white text/icon) as an e-ink "needs attention" signal.
- **`font_dir`** and **`use_system_fonts`** display settings: use a
  directory of custom font files, or resvg's own system font
  fallback, to render scripts the bundled Roboto font doesn't cover
  (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic, CJK).
- **Localized forecast/calendar day labels**: weekday, month, and
  relative-date ("today"/"tomorrow"/"in N days") labels in the
  Weather forecast and Waste Schedule/Calendar widgets now follow
  the display's configured language instead of always English.
- **Graph widget**: `start_time` to anchor the window to a fixed
  time of day, `state_font_size` to control header text size,
  `show_legend` to hide the per-entity legend independently, and
  `secondary_upper_bound`/`secondary_lower_bound` to pin the
  secondary Y-axis range. Multi-entity headers now show every
  entity's state instead of only the first.
- **`heading_align`** option on the Heading widget to right-align
  the title.
- **Config flow**: the "Copy dashboard YAML" export now isolates
  oversized displays into their own full-width Lovelace section
  instead of squeezing them into a row with much smaller displays.

### Changed

- **Entity widget redesigned**: icon now sits on the left with the
  value/unit as the primary black text and a repositionable,
  alignable gray name, matching the Tile widget's visual priority.
- **`display_levels`** (renamed from `grayscale_levels`; existing
  configs are migrated automatically) now affects widget rendering
  independent of e-ink optimization, and moved out of the collapsed
  "Advanced" section to a top-level Display Settings field.

### Fixed

- **Seeed reTerminal E1003** device preset now declares its correct
  native landscape orientation, fixing a spurious 90° rotation that
  produced a portrait PNG for the default landscape setup. Existing
  dashboards are fixed automatically on upgrade via a config entry
  migration; no manual reconfiguration is needed.
- Entity icons defined via `icons.json` (e.g. the `moon`
  integration's state-dependent icons) are now resolved instead of
  falling back to a plain letter.
- Graph widget legend: a name override on the primary entity is no
  longer dropped, and long names are truncated instead of
  overlapping adjacent entries.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Color e-ink palette support**: displays with a `color_scheme`
  configured (BWR, BWY, BWRY, BWGBRY) are now rendered and dithered in
  RGB instead of grayscale.
- **Seeed reTerminal E1002** device preset (800×480, Spectra 6-color /
  BWGBRY).
- **`dither_algorithm`** display setting: choose between
  Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, Stucki, and Burkes dithering, powered by
  the new `epaper-dithering` library (replaces Pillow's built-in
  Floyd-Steinberg quantization).
- **`measured_palette`** display setting: use a photographically
  calibrated color/gray palette from `epaper-dithering` instead of the
  idealized default.
- **`exposure`** and **`saturation`** display settings, replacing
  `sharpness` and `contrast` as pre-dithering image adjustments.
- **`hide_name`** option on the Entity and Sensor widgets to show only
  the value with no name label.
- **`bold_value`** option on the Entity, Sensor, Entities, Tile,
  Gauge, Graph, Device Battery, Waste Schedule, and Calendar widgets.
- **Attribute-based data source** for the Graph widget: plot a
  time-series list from an entity attribute (e.g. solar production or
  price forecasts) instead of only recorder state history.

### Changed

- Display settings: `grayscale_levels`, and the new `exposure` /
  `saturation` sliders are now grouped under a collapsed "Advanced"
  section in the config flow.
- Entity, Sensor, and Entities widgets: the state value is now the
  dominant, black, bold-weight element and the name/label is smaller
  and gray, matching at-a-glance e-ink dashboard priorities.
- Tile, Waste Schedule, and Calendar widgets: values render in solid
  black and names in gray (previously the reverse).

### Fixed

- Seeed reTerminal E1001/E1003 presets no longer double-dither:
  `optimize` defaults to off for these devices since HA Core's
  OpenDisplay integration already dithers before sending over BLE; the
  Display Settings UI now explains why the toggle is disabled.
- Graph widget history fetches now go through the recorder's own
  executor, eliminating repeated "detected blocking call" warnings
  from Home Assistant.

### Removed

- `sharpness` and `contrast` display settings, superseded by
  `exposure` and `saturation` (existing configs are migrated
  automatically).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **Graph widget**: time-series line chart for one or more numeric entities,
  with configurable `hours_to_show`, `smoothing`, axis labels, grid lines,
  `group_by` aggregation, `extrema` markers, `min_bound_range`, and
  multi-entity overlay support.
- **Bar chart mode** for the Graph widget (`chart_type: "bar"`).
- **Color threshold styling** for the Graph widget: segments change color
  based on configurable value thresholds.
- **Gauge widget**: arc-style gauge for a single numeric entity with
  configurable `min`, `max`, and optional color thresholds.
- **Frame widget**: decorative card with rounded corners for visual grouping,
  with no entity data of its own.
- **Calendar widget**: upcoming-events list sourced from HA calendar entities.
- **Custom sensor overrides** for the Weather widget: replace the built-in
  temperature, humidity, or wind sensors with arbitrary entity IDs.
- **`hide_icon`** option on the Entity and Tile widgets to suppress the icon
  circle entirely.
- **`hide_fill`** and **`hide_state`** options on the Sensor widget sparkline.
- **Seeed reTerminal E1001 and E1003** device presets in the config flow.

### Changed

- Widget SVG backgrounds are now transparent, enabling correct compositing
  when widgets overlap or when the dashboard background shows through.

### Fixed

- Config flow: `grayscale_levels` is now coerced to `int` before validation,
  preventing a type error when the value arrives as a string.

### Performance

- Frontend editor skips redundant SVG renders instead of queuing them,
  reducing unnecessary server round-trips during rapid widget edits.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

* Fixed release pipeline

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Sensor widget**: single-entity sensor card with optional sparkline history
  graph (`graph: "line"`), configurable `hours_to_show`, `detail` level, and
  fixed Y-axis `limits`.
- **Entities widget**: multi-entity list card with optional title, inline
  divider rows (`type: "divider"`), and section rows (`type: "section"`).
- **Entity widget**: large-value single-entity card showing state and unit,
  mirroring HA's Entity card.
- **Heading widget**: section heading with optional MDI icon and entity badges,
  superseding the deprecated Text widget.
- **Locale-aware number formatting**: per-device decimal and thousands
  separator override (decimal comma, decimal point, or HA default) settable
  in the integration options.
- **Visibility conditions**: all widgets now support a `visibility` list to
  show or hide based on entity state or other HA conditions.
- **Editor drag-and-drop reordering**: widget order can be changed by dragging
  rows in the widget list, replacing the previous up/down arrow buttons.
- **Editor live SVG preview scaling**: the preview panel scales
  proportionally while a widget is being resized.

### Changed

- Row dividers in Entities, Waste Schedule, and Weather widgets now render in
  light gray (`#b4b4b4`) instead of medium gray, improving visual hierarchy on
  16-level grayscale displays.  No change on 2-level (TRMNL) displays.
- Entity and Sensor widget header icon enlarged for better legibility on
  e-ink screens.
- Design tool default dashboard (no `--widget` flag) now previews all key
  widget types: Weather, Tile, Entity, Sensor (with sparkline), Waste
  Schedule, and Device Battery.

### Removed

- Deprecated widget types `text` (use `heading`), `sensor_rows`, and
  `status_icons` removed from the renderer and widget picker.  Existing
  configs that reference these types will no longer render.

### Fixed

- Entity and Sensor header icon circle now has consistent padding from the
  top card border (previously the circle clipped the border line).
- Heading widget had double padding below the title under
  `card_style: "border"`.
- Weather and Device Battery widgets: content soft-padding now applied
  consistently when `card_style: "none"`.
- Widget picker showed raw MDI icon strings instead of glyphs for Entities
  and Sensor card types.
- Waste Schedule, Tile, and Heading icon circle strokes are now widened on
  2-level (TRMNL) displays to prevent dithering artifacts.
- `recorder` integration declared in `after_dependencies` so history data is
  available when the Sensor widget fetches it at startup.
- Translation selector keys for date format settings corrected to lowercase.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Media Source platform exposing rendered dashboard PNGs in HA's Media Browser,
  enabling delivery to screens running [OpenDisplay](https://opendisplay.org/).
- TRMNL battery level support in the `device_battery` widget.
- Snap-to-widget-edges in the Lovelace editor: hold Shift while dragging a
  widget to align it to the nearest edge of any other widget.
- Design tool: interactive resize handles on the Raw SVG preview panel.
  Corner handles resize width and height; left/right edge handles resize
  width only. A dashed blue outline tracks the widget bounds, and handles
  snap to the widget's actual rendered content area.

### Changed

- Editor resize model: corner handles (nw/ne/sw/se) resize width and
  height; left/right edge handles (w/e) resize width only. Font size
  scales proportionally on corner resize for text and weather widgets.
- Bumped `resvg-py` to 0.3.2 for fontdb caching support.
- Weather widget: main temperature is now rendered in bold.

### Fixed

- Spurious `RuntimeError` logged during HA shutdown when the image
  refresh executor is already stopped is now suppressed.
- `device_battery` widget resize box now matches the rendered content
  width instead of a hardcoded 200 px default.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- SVG rendering pipeline: all widgets are now rendered as Jinja2 SVG templates
  rasterised by `resvg-py`, replacing the PIL drawing infrastructure.
- WebSocket commands `eink_dashboard/render_widget` and
  `eink_dashboard/render_widgets` for fetching server-rendered SVG previews
  from the Lovelace editor.
- Shared SVG macro library (`_macros.svg.j2`) for card borders, dividers, and
  other reusable layout primitives.
- `mdi_svg` and `weather_svg` Jinja2 filters for inlining MDI and weather
  icons directly into SVG templates.
- State circle indicator on `status_icons` widget, controlled by the new
  `show_icon` and `show_state` options.
- Card container (`card_style`) support for the `text` widget.
- Standalone design tool (`tools/design_widget.py`) for iterating on widget
  layouts outside of Home Assistant.
- CI job publishing JUnit test results to GitHub Actions.

### Changed

- Editor canvas preview replaced by server-rendered SVGs; drag and resize
  interactions rewritten accordingly.
- `status_icons` widget redesigned from pill chips to icon-and-text labels.
- Config flow screen-portion selection step restricted to TRMNL devices only.
- TRMNL documentation URL standardised to `trmnl.com`.
- Build tooling migrated from tox to `uv`.

### Removed

- `LINE` widget type.
- PIL drawing infrastructure (`render.py` PIL helpers).
- cairosvg icon build pipeline.

### Fixed

- Widget SVG viewport clipped to the widget's content dimensions, preventing
  overflow into adjacent widgets.
- Card border inset now included in the `device_battery` natural-width
  calculation.
- Weather forecasts are now fetched in the SVG preview WebSocket handlers so
  the editor shows live forecast data.
- Config flow orientation indicator shown in the screen-portion step title.
